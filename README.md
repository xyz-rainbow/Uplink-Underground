# 📡 Uplink Underground: Speculative Mirror
> "Turning the world's noise into the city's propaganda."

Speculative Mirror is a "Dystopian Translation" engine that ingests real-world OSINT data and transmutes it into immersive chronicles of a cyberpunk future. It is not just a news aggregator; it is a lens that refracts reality through neon, crisis, and chrome.

## The "Speculative Mirror" Logic

At its core, the application utilizes the Dystopian Translator engine to process raw information into atmospheric storytelling:

1. **Data Ingestion (OSINT)**
   Using a mapping interface and location-based coordinates, the system scrapes real-world news from Google Search and local feeds. Reality is our raw material.

2. **Narrative Synthesis**
   Leveraging LLM logic, the engine maps economic or social data into a "High-Tech, Low-Life" context.
   * *Example:* A "boring" interest rate hike is reframed as an "Iron Vault Credit Tax" imposed on the city's neon districts.

3. **Persona-Driven Interpretation**
   Users select different Speaker Profiles that dictate the bias and tone of the report:
   * **X-7 "REBEL" AI**: Anarchist, aggressive, and anti-corporate tone.
   * **ARASAKA-VOX 900**: Clean, cold, and authoritarian corporate propaganda.

## Artistic & Technical Layer

### Procedural Audio & Sentiment Sync
The experience is sensory. The system features a dynamic audio engine that reacts to the news data:
- **Real-Time Synthesis:** Generates synthwave or industrial tracks on the fly.
- **Dynamic Tuning:** Track parameters—such as tempo, filter resonance, and distortion—are tuned based on the Sentiment Analysis (Aggressive, Melancholy, Corporate, etc.) of the current news stream.

## Technical Stack

- **Architecture:** React / Vite / TypeScript
- **Narrative Engine:** Google Gemini (via `@google/genai`)
- **Interface:** CRT Terminal / D3.js / Leaflet
- **Styling:** Lucide React / CSS Modules

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the transmission:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Establish Uplink:**
   Open the application in your browser. You will be prompted to enter your **Gemini API Key**. The key is stored locally in your browser and is not shared with any server other than Google's API.
